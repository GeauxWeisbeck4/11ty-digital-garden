This is an example journal entry. It's purpose is to render in the `postslist.njk` component to help test this starter while developing it as well as showcasing how the post content can be used in this specific component for future users. 

## Posts List Component (`postslist.njk`)

The posts list component makes it easy for you to group posts content together to share on any page you desire. The most common use is to render this component on your home or landing page to showcase your favorite or most recent posts. More specific instructions can be found in the [documentation category of the notes catalog for the 11ty Digital Garden Starter Demo](/src/content/notes/note-category.md). 

## What Kind of Content Should I Use Posts For?

Anything you want! I use the posts to render my daily journal entries. You will be able to find a few examples of how I use post examples on the starter demo page so you can get an idea on how you can customize it to fit your needs.
